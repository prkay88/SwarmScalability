TO DO:::
  1) Improve long range attraction such that the swarm keeps its density
  2) Implement behavior for those that have seen Beacon
    i) Create a state that reflects having seen the Beacon
    ii) change FlockingVector so that it takes a repulsion distance as a parameter
  3) Change the ControlStep method to switch on the different states
    i) This involves creating all of the states we need and what behavior they should do in each state
  4) Decide on how we want to say the flock has achieved its goal (Exit Condition)
  5) Write output to files that we can Parse
    i) We will need the number of robots and the amount of time to reach the Beacon
  6) In matlab or python write script to parse data and put it into a form we can plot
  7) Implement sending of states through the RAB sensor.
  8) Write bash script to automate expirement runs.
  9) Put type of error in XML
